# User Roles

#### How to create roles?

Currently there are no APIs present in UserOrg service to do role management. If any new role needs to be added it is done through DB script.&#x20;

Sample Script:

<pre><code><strong>insert into sunbird.role (id,name,rolegroupid,status) values ('PROGRAM_MANAGER','Program Manager',['PROGRAM_MANAGER'],1);
</strong>insert into sunbird.role_group (id,name) values ('PROGRAM_MANAGER','Program Manager');</code></pre>

#### **To fetch the roles in the system,** below API can be used:

```
GET /v1/role/read
```

#### **To fetch roles of a specific user,** below API can be used:

```
GET /v1/user/role/read/:uid 
```

#### To assign roles to a user, below APIs can be used: ([API Documentation](https://lern.sunbird.org/learn/product-and-developer-guide/user-and-org-service/api-documentation/user-management))

<pre><code>POST /v2/user/assign/role
<strong>POST /private/user/v2/assign/role</strong></code></pre>
