**Project: Making SB Lern Cloud Agnostic**

**Task : Completion of Data migration  (**[**LR-254**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-4)**)**

CSP data migration task for certificates in RC.&#x20;

**Project: Sunbird Lern integration with SB RC**

**Task : Completion of Sunbird RC integration with Lern (**[**LR-4**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-4)**,** [**LR-6**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-6)**)**

Integration of Sunbird RC with Sunbird Lern has been taken up over the last 2 releases in order to facilitate Registry driven credentials. A few pending backlog items in this project will be completed as part of Release 5.1.0, including migration of certificates issued so far to Sunbird RC.&#x20;

**Project: New Feature Development**

**Task: Support for Optional material for Courses (**[**LR-1**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-1)**)**

All Course content is considered as mandatory for course completion as of today. There is a functional need called out for being able to add 'optional' material to courses - such that it does not contribute to course progress. This project will cover Lern changes that need to be done in order to enable Optional material for courses

**Task : Course progress exhaust to capture number of attempts (**[**LR-127**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-127)**)**

The current Course progress exhaust is required to be enhanced to capture the number of attempts that a user has made against the assessment tagged to the course.&#x20;

**Project: Enabling ease of Adoption**

**Task: Refactoring of SB Lern Batch Service (**[**LR-131**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-131)**)**

There are a few dependencies for the course service APIs and the DB layers that need to be resolved in order to remove the dependecies that Lern has on SB Obsrv and Knowlg.

**Note :**&#x20;

The team was engaged with an interrupt - i.e. work on [CSP support](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-147) related items over the months of September and October 2022. The next release for SB Lern will be 5.1, for which Sprint 1 will commence on 31 Oct 2022.

| The code base of some of the components are spread across different building blocks. This makes the installation and setup difficult. Due to this PR approval and merge takes time. Decoupling the code from other BB repos will help to maintain the repos and code most efficiently. For example, batch service code is spread across many repositories like Sunbird Knowlg, Sunbird Obsrv. Also sunbird-utils repo has the cassandra migration scripts from all components - this needs to be separated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
